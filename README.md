# Obsidian Browser Preview

Ever wanted to see or print the preview generated by Obsidian? Using this plugin, you can get a new menu option allowing you to open your current document's preview in your default browser so you can do anything with it that you could do in your normal browser.

Designed for Obsidian 0.9.7's Obsidian Plugin API.

## Use

1. Open a preview window for one of your documents.
2. From the `Ctrl+p` menu, select the "Browser Preview: Open preview in browser" option. You'll then find that your default browser has been opened up to the relevant preview.
